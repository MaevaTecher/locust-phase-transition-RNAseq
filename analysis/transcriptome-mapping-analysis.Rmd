# 1 | Brief background: locust phase polyphenism

> add description here

# 2 | Preparation for the analysis
## 2.1. Use a conda environment

> add what to install on the Macpro tower
> e.g., we install a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#) called **rna-seq**

## 2.2. Use modules on TAMU Grace cluster

We use a Snakemake pipeline for each species. Therefore, verifying that the software is installed as a module beforehand on the Grace cluster at Texas A&M University is essential. In addition, each module requires some dependencies, which is why we need to ensure they will be loaded together.  

For this we use the function `module spider` [targeted software] w/o the version.
